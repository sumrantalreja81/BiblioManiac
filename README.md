## ❓BiblioManiac App 

BIBLIO-MANIAC is an excessive fondness for acquiring and possessing books. Book Lovers know that there’s so much more to a book than just reading it. Do you love reading so much, you’ve even tried to join a book club? Biblio-maniac is an app for all the book lovers out there who want to read as many books as possible so to make this easier Three’s Company came up with an innovative idea of building an online bookstore for all the biblio-maniacs out there but with a twist. The medium of buying and selling book is not in the form of money rather it works on BARTER SYSTEM. Bibliomaniacs on our app will exchange books in order to read more.

## ❓Need of the App

The purpose was quite apparent, why should we stop our reading just because of the capital issue. It always is helpful to people of your kind; this app can help meet-up all the book lovers at a single platform where in you can know more about the different genres and enhance your knowledge with the people with more experience. You can filter out books according to the different categories to save your time and meet people who have same taste in reading as you.

## ❓Benefits

This idea was brought just for the sole purpose of maximising the reading efficiency without the thoughts of pricing issues in addition to reduction of environmental damage. Rather than selling books or keeping them just occupying space we can save our time, money and energy just by using an app. 

## ❓Working of App

Biblio-maniac has multiple buttons serving different purposes first comes the “filter through categories” wherein you can search the genres of the book that you are interested in and look for the particular books and save time. Another button “Timeline” comes with an option wherein you can look up for the book and meet the people alike you. Third tab is your “Profile”. This tab will show your collection of books you want to exchange to others. Last and fourth tab is “About App” which will provide user users with walkthrough and explain new updates to regular users.

## ❓Future Goals:

We plan on adding a selling option for second-hand books so that user who are not interested in exchanging can also look up to this app for books. Also, we plan on adding a feature wherein people with like taste can meet-up arrange live sessions to share experience and interest other people in reading programs.
